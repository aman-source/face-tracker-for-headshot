Precision AimBot with Facial Tracking (Toy Gun)
This project involves the development of a precision AimBot system that controls a toy gun using facial tracking. The system leverages computer vision techniques and Arduino for real-time target acquisition and aiming.

Technology Stack: OpenCV, cvzone.FaceDetectionModule, Arduino, Servo Motors.
Core Features:
Implemented facial tracking to control servo motors, converting forehead coordinates into precise aiming angles.
Enabled real-time tracking and target locking to maintain focus on the moving target.
Integrated a trigger mechanism that fires the toy gun when the Enter key is pressed.
This project demonstrates the application of computer vision and embedded systems in creating an interactive and automated targeting system.
